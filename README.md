# Unity 2.5D-RPG-Project
This is a Unity Based 2.5d RPG project I dump some hours into every few months or so. Currently the project is composed of 3 scenes.
1. The Title Screen where players can pick a save slot.
2. Character creation Screen, where players can use customization tools to create a character. Visual only right now, the game doesnt have a stats system as of yet
3. The World. Currently writing in additional features to optimize world generation.
