# Unity 2.5D-RPG-Project
This is a Unity Based 2.5d RPG project I dump some hours into every few months or so. Currently the project is composed of 3 scenes.
1. The Title Screen where players can pick a save slot.
2. Character creation Screen, where players can use customization tools to create a character. Visual only right now, the game doesnt have a stats system as of yet
3. The World, I gotta change this one. It has a system in place but its clunky and brittle. It was a nice starting point but I have ideas for a way more dynamic world generator. Its definitely more complicated but the way I was doing it before was so disgustingly inefficient its time for a change. It is currently being rewritten

Disclaimer: Large portions of this code are still in prototype mode and are fairly brittle.
