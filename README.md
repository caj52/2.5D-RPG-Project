# 2.5D-RPG-Project
This is a 2.5d RPG project I dump some hours into every few months or so. Currently the project is composed of 3 scenes.
1. The Title Screen where players can pick a save slot.
2. Character creation Screen, where players can use customization tools to create a character. Visual only right now, the game doesnt have a stats system as of yet
3. The World, this is the big one. Being a procedurally generated game, a considerable amount of time has been put into R&D and finding the best hierarchical layout for the procedural
generation system. Currently the system is in a sort of paradox. Systems have been written and autonomously generate the initial base for the world. As of currently,
the creation variables, such as elevation, texture, and different "biomes" all have a place in the backend, but have yet to be fine tuned.
