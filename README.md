# Unity 2.5D-RPG-Project
This is a Unity Based 2.5d RPG project. Conceptually, I'm going for a mixture of Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, and The Sims, mixed with popular mechanics from RPGS, such as stats and skill trees. RPG questing and adventure in a fully procedural, infinte world. Where you can take control of an adventurer and guide their decisions, relationships, and goals.

I'm trying to get all new art for the game but boy is getting 8 directional sprites challenging. And expensive. So thats a pretty big undertaking. 
Currently all the art is placeholder. I wish I was good at pixel art but alas, progmomming is my true love

Currently the project is composed of 3 scenes.
1. The Title Screen where players can pick a save slot.
2. Character creation Screen, where players can use customization tools to create a character. Visual only right now, the game doesnt have a stats system as of yet
3. The World. The basic systems have all but been written so right now I'm focusing on fleshing them out. IE adding more zones, objects, dialing in the procedural generation variables. I'm starting out on some gameplay stuff now as well!

I log my progress and plan out upcoming things on my Trello. I also do a lot of my problem solving there. Feel free to check it out.
